# Meet Ups and Events Rails Application

This rails project is a web application that allows users to make accounts, and login through either their created account or through github. Once a user has a account, they can reserve to events, create their own events, and leave reviews for events they have attended. There is also a search bar for users to search for events by name and also a link for users to see reviews that were recently created.

# Installation and Usage

To install this project, fork and clone this repo to get it, and then run `bundle install` to get all the gems required to run, and then do `rake db:migrate`, and then `rake db:seed` to get the database filled with accounts, events, reservations, and reviews.
